The system has been developed under a Linux system with gcc and should
compile on any Linux systems. More gnerally it should compile under most Unix
systems.

Go to the src/ sub-directory.

Modify the Makefile if needed (mainly the CFLAGS options)

  if you want to compile a version with debug support define the DEBUG macro
   (e.g. pass -DDEBUG to gcc)

  If you want to compile with log file support define the LOG_FILE macro

  For best performances use -fomit-frame-pointer -O3 under gcc.

  Several lines are present in the Makefile as comments. Uncomment the one you
  need.

To  compile locally use:

% make

By default the Makefile also compiles all benchmarks. But you can use:

% make <bench> to only compile a give benchamrk

or 

% make libad_solver.a to only compile the library


If you want to install the library in another location, you need to copy in
the target location the following files:

 - header files: ad_solver.h main.h tools.h
 - libraries: libad_solver.a 

To clean the result of the local compilation use:

% make clean

To re-create a source distributio use:

% make dist

If you need to change the version number modify the file ../VERSION
